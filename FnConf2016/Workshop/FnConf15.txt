As the journey began, the organization had to leapfrog into 3x growth in terms of both people and business needs due to a round of substantial investor funding.<\/p>\r\n<p>The agile transformation started with just 6 teams in the organization and due to the nature of the team structure, the 3-member PMO team did not have the luxury for pilot projects and had to simultaniously roll out at one go across the 6+ component teams.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a span of 6 months, the number of teams grew to 12+ and the number of releases more than doubled. Also, 80% of the releases cut across more than 3 teams and the challenge was to keep the process pretty lean. PMO team worked closely with key stakeholders from Product, Engineering, Architecture and Operations to forumate and roll-out a simple 3 step process that aided the teams to deliver releases better than before. Here is when the organization leaped from project to portfolio of releases cutting across 10+ themes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Similar to what is quoted in the \"Scaled Agile Framework\" which the PMO tripped on much later in the process, there were organization wide prioritization done based on the product strategy, infrastructure and technology needs which eventually got translated into multiple programs within the organization, cutting across various teams. A concept of 3-in-a-box (PM, Architect and Engineering Owner) was formulated to bring in the required vigor in to the planning and execution process.The 3 in the box was further extended to Dev +QA + Ops who worked as a team to deliver the various stories across the contributing stacks.<\/p>\r\n<p>The challenges across value-driven prioritization from 100+ releases across the portfolio, release planning with engineering and product, the execution framework and scalability in engineering infrastructure commensurate with the agile processes, working with operations teams and all the way till adoption was seamlessly scaled using the initial framework that was set for just 15 releases.<\/p>\r\n<p>The presentation details how agile helped and is helping the product and technology teams in delivering better results than before. This would also detail the necessary Agile and operational metrics across the project teams, the program and the portfolio levels that aid the mid and senior management to take informed decisions.

In order to move towards a continuous delivery approach, the practice of trunk based development suggests ways to avoid this type of issues among others like inconsistent feature sets, code that stays in an undeployable state for a long time, regressions introduced by semantic differences that arise during those joyful merging sessions, integration surprises with the other features, and the like.

To work with a single tech stack promotes a sense of mono culture which is detrimental and limiting the way a solution can be designed.

We will explore how to use this playful technique to collaboratively elicit information about user requirements and strategic design issues using the open source User Requirements with Lego methodology developed by a team at the University of Lugano, Switzerland. &nbsp;This approach is particularly suited to Agile teams that want to get team members and stakeholders sharing their different perspectives on common goals in an open and light-weight manner.<\/p>","session_type":"Workshop","theme":"Agile Lifecycle","level":"Beginner","slides":"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/slideshow\/embed_code\/key\/FIDUGGSlopHzuD","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tG_RrWgWOEw?feature=oembed","co_authors":"","url":"http:\/\/confengine.com\/agile-india-2014\/proposal\/34","track_span":1,"slot":[1393574400,1393579800],"speakers":[{"name":"Ellen Grove","key":"ellen-grove","pic":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ea28d84e6e3d19a94e4156a89483a8cf?s=50&r=pg&d=mm","link":"\/user\/ellen-grove","country":"Canada","flag":"\/assets\/img\/flags\/ca.png","organization":"Agile Partnership"}]}],"2014-02-28 13:55:00":[{"id":"88","track":"Track 2","conf_id":"agile-india-2014","room":"Esquire","timeslot":"2014-02-28 13:55:00","proposal_id":"211","title":"Changing our Rhythm: Our Ongoing Journey towards Continuous Delivery","duration":"20","abstract":"<p>Annual software release cycles cramping the agility of the team? Too many hot fixes reducing the efficiency of your organization? Customers waiting impatientlyfor &nbsp;the next cool features hot off the press? These are some of the painful and common problems faced by development teams worldwide. In today's world, most things get outdated or out-of-fashion very fast - and software is no different. Users cannot afford to wait for the next cool set of features for a year. They want a steady stream of cool new features that they can adopt and use immediately.<\/p>\r\n<p>My team follows a development model that we like to call Open Commercial Development - where we're always connected to our stakeholders, our plans are out in the open, and we're always gathering feedback and reprioritizing. We used to have yearly releases of our product - a sort of big bang release with a host of new featres. Based on our stakeholder interactions, however, we figured that our software delivery wasn't agile enough for our customers. Users wanted new features incrementally throughout the year. They especially didn't want to wait a year for a feature that they'd requested that was critical for their business.<\/p>\r\n<p>So began our journey to Continuous Delivery - an interesting one for sure. It's not easy to deliver new features, manage technical debt, collaborate with users and incorporate their feedback into the new features - once every quarter. To do it consistently, with quality and on time, you need to have a framework in place - a combination of planning, process, automation and team organization - that lets teams focus on the right things to get to DONE DONE for their new features, and at the same time manage their quality and tecnical debt. Over the past year, we like to think that we've put that framework in place, and that is what I'd like to talk about in this session.<\/p>","session_type":"Experience Report","theme":"Agile Lifecycle","level":"Beginner","slides":"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0BwYBFB3pqkZsZmdkNnNwNDlwYkE\/edit?usp=sharing","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XlNNgtms1Q8?feature=oembed","co_authors":"","url":"http:\/\/confengine.com\/agile-india-2014\/proposal\/211","track_span":1,"slot":[1393575900,1393577100],"speakers":[{"name":"Sreerupa Sen","key":"sreerupa-sen","pic":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d98a75f037f122a8e595ebd6a602d6e1?s=50&r=pg&d=mm","link":"\/user\/sreerupa-sen","country":"India","flag":"\/assets\/img\/flags\/in.png","organization":"IBM"}]}],"2014-02-28 14:30:00":[{"id":"90","track":"Track 1","conf_id":"agile-india-2014","room":"Grand Ball Room","timeslot":"2014-02-28 14:30:00","proposal_id":"246","title":"Why The Project Paradigm Kills Innovation, and What To Do Instead","duration":"45","abstract":"<p>Projects were invented as a vehicle for managing civil engineering projects.

Here in this case the system could be a team member, the manager, the management, or the entire organization. While we work with assumptions, the conversations or the discussions or the work we do, can seem like getting nowhere because of the conflicts, and a sense of frustration piles on .This is a common situation and a very common feeling amongst Coaches\/Scrum masters\/Project Managers or anyone dealing with project management scenarios. That is where \"contracting\" helps us get our way through!<\/p>\r\n<p>Contracting is a concept of \"Transactional Analysis\" school of psychology. Eric Berne defines it as \"an explicit bilateral commitment to a well-defined course of action\". Sometimes contracts will be multi-handed - all parties to the contract will have their own expectations. In the unusual event that these are all congruent, then fine. However, if not, then discussing everyone's expectations will lead to greater understanding and therefore to a clear contract. The risk in not doing this is that problems in completing the contract will emerge at some stage.<\/p>\r\n<p>3 Categories of contracts are administrative, professional and psychological.<\/p>\r\n<p>Administrative contracts deals with the operational agreements- like fees, who has to do what, time, frequency, attendees etc.<\/p>\r\n<p>Professional contracts deals with the expectations from each role and clarifies the essential setup required to achieve the same<\/p>\r\n<p>Psychological contracts talks about how we work as people and help to understand how we express our comforts\/ discomforts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Amongst the three contracts psychological contracts are very essential and often ignored in projects.

With faster time to market, better feedback and highly functioning teams, the Agile mindset opens our eyes to a better way of working as humans on large complicated and complex problems. Combining it with the concepts of Lean Startup, delivers another leap in team capacity and capabilities. It also opens the possibilities of using agility for more than just software development. <br \/><br \/>Do you wonder how can we drive innovation in a disciplined way to tame our world's toughest problems? Can we apply the lessons learned from Agile and Lean Startup? Over the past three years, we've been able to apply agility at a new level, beyond business impact.

Sadly, those models were predominantly based on industrial work, and don't really work that well in knowledge industry and today's sociological dynamics at workplace. Classical Agile methods codify several people practices that allow for a self-organizing team to evolve, but doesn't offer a lot of guidance on how to develop and groom leadership for agile organizations beyond a software team. Management 3.0 takes this issue further and develops it into a separate discipline altogether. On similar lines, Holacracy seeks to create social technology for purposeful organizations, though not specially targeting software organizations. So, the issue of leadership still continues to be unresolved and rather left to pave its way on its own. Unfortunately, when we want to achieve true end-to-end agility, it is not enough for software teams to be charging at top speeds but leadership not evenly matched to support them well in their endeavors. We clearly have a problem at hand...<\/p>\r\n<p>In this talk, we will study how the role of leadership has evolved and what does it look like for agile organizations at present. Many agile methods take an extreme view that limit leadership to team-level collective ownership of leadership. However, that might not be enough because of various reasons. In any non-trivial organization, whether a software organizations or any modern business employing software for business advantage, the reality is that organization units beyond a plain-vanilla software teams do exist. So, how does one go about grooming their top talent for playing an effective part in this process?<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, we will also try to take a shot at some of evolving paradigms. For example, all these management thoughts are still based on the kind of outdated premise that an organization is based on 'boundaries' of operations. However, already we see that model being broken down, and the future teams look more like boundaryless entities bound with nothing but a unifying purpose that brings a bunch of volunteers together for a period of time. If our success increasing depends on such teams being able to effectively self-manage themselves, what role does leadership have to play in it, and are we getting ready for it?&nbsp;<\/p>","session_type":"Talk","theme":"Beyond Agile","level":"Advanced","slides":"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/slideshow\/embed_code\/key\/GvEOo2S6TlJ7BC","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/az5GBr1um0A?feature=oembed","co_authors":"","url":"http:\/\/confengine.com\/agile-india-2014\/proposal\/157","track_span":1,"slot":[1393653600,1393656300],"speakers":[{"name":"Tathagat Varma","key":"tathagat-varma","pic":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/bdd1fd492efd673ba6a5342cf9ec5df2?s=50&r=pg&d=mm","link":"\/user\/tathagat-varma","country":"India","flag":"\/assets\/img\/flags\/in.png","organization":"Thought Leadership"}]},{"id":"8","track":"Track 2","conf_id":"agile-india-2014","room":"Esquire","timeslot":"2014-03-01 11:30:00","proposal_id":"43","title":"Should we stop using Story Points and Velocity?","duration":"20","abstract":"<p class=\"p1\">On Agile projects we estimate user stories in order to allow team to<\/p>\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n<li class=\"li2\">1.

To create and collaborate to keep a customer is the purpose of an organisation. But still lots of companies try to make bad profits, i.e. profits earned at the expense of customer relationships. The Net Promoter System (NPS) is a renowned open-source system which addresses and measures customer collaboration. And did you know that you not only can use it to get feedback on your products and services, but also on your employees and your personal performance?<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">NPS is a perfect fit for Agile companies - and those who want to be. Most of the companies I worked with (Agile coaching, training, consulting) had not heard about it, and far less were actually using it. This really surprises me, since NPS integrates like a charm with Agile, e.g. within product development via Scrum.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this session I'll explain the basics of NPS, i.e. promoters and detractors, satisfied and delighted customers, bad profits (how to deal with bad feedback?) and good profits, and why and how to measure these. Several stories from companies like Apple Retail, Zappos, Southwest Airlines, and others will help to make my point. I&rsquo;ll further show why NPS is a very good fit with Agile regarding products, employees, and personal performance. Dos and Don&rsquo;ts regarding NPS (also from personal experience) will close this session.

We will explore together approaches that are suitable to each perspective and how to activate them in your team, division or organization.<\/p>","session_type":"Talk","theme":"Scaling Agile Adoption","level":"Intermediate","slides":"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/slideshow\/embed_code\/key\/fUm26cbyX0wPxx","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eV3S05QTjwQ?feature=oembed","co_authors":"michael-spayd","url":"http:\/\/confengine.com\/agile-india-2014\/proposal\/253","track_span":1,"slot":[1393390800,1393393500],"speakers":[{"name":"Lyssa Adkins","key":"lyssa-adkins","pic":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/abb01ffdbfd6b0de700fc6f972a122e8?s=50&r=pg&d=http%3A%2F%2Fconfengine.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2Fspeakers%2FLyssaAdkins.png","link":"\/user\/lyssa-adkins","country":"United States","flag":"\/assets\/img\/flags\/us.png","organization":"Agile Coaching Institute"},{"name":"Michael Spayd","key":"michael-spayd","pic":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6e8bfd347f2081820b0daf01ee15ec26?s=50&r=pg&d=http%3A%2F%2Fconfengine.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2Fspeakers%2FMichaelSpayd.png","link":"\/user\/michael-spayd","country":"United States","flag":"\/assets\/img\/flags\/us.png","organization":"Agile Coaching Institute"}]},{"id":"43","track":"Track 2","conf_id":"agile-india-2014","room":"Esquire","timeslot":"2014-02-26 10:30:00","proposal_id":"41","title":"From Lean Startup to Agile Enterprise (beyond IT)","duration":"45","abstract":"<p>Traditional models of management and corporate governance are failing to keep up with the needs of the modern economy.

The concept of cross functional team should be extended to not just the team but also to the individuals within the team. Scott Ambler wrote an essay on \"Generalising Specialist\". The term T-shaped developer was introduced by Mary and Tom Poppendieck in her famous book \"Lean Software Development\".

As the journey began, the organization had to leapfrog into 3x growth in terms of both people and business needs due to a round of substantial investor funding.<\/p>\r\n<p>The agile transformation started with just 6 teams in the organization and due to the nature of the team structure, the 3-member PMO team did not have the luxury for pilot projects and had to simultaniously roll out at one go across the 6+ component teams.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a span of 6 months, the number of teams grew to 12+ and the number of releases more than doubled. Also, 80% of the releases cut across more than 3 teams and the challenge was to keep the process pretty lean. PMO team worked closely with key stakeholders from Product, Engineering, Architecture and Operations to forumate and roll-out a simple 3 step process that aided the teams to deliver releases better than before. Here is when the organization leaped from project to portfolio of releases cutting across 10+ themes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Similar to what is quoted in the \"Scaled Agile Framework\" which the PMO tripped on much later in the process, there were organization wide prioritization done based on the product strategy, infrastructure and technology needs which eventually got translated into multiple programs within the organization, cutting across various teams. A concept of 3-in-a-box (PM, Architect and Engineering Owner) was formulated to bring in the required vigor in to the planning and execution process.The 3 in the box was further extended to Dev +QA + Ops who worked as a team to deliver the various stories across the contributing stacks.<\/p>\r\n<p>The challenges across value-driven prioritization from 100+ releases across the portfolio, release planning with engineering and product, the execution framework and scalability in engineering infrastructure commensurate with the agile processes, working with operations teams and all the way till adoption was seamlessly scaled using the initial framework that was set for just 15 releases.<\/p>\r\n<p>The presentation details how agile helped and is helping the product and technology teams in delivering better results than before. This would also detail the necessary Agile and operational metrics across the project teams, the program and the portfolio levels that aid the mid and senior management to take informed decisions.

Even if you are not a developer on your team you will benefit from the examples and techniques presented.<\/p>","session_type":"Talk","theme":"Offshore Distributed Agile","level":"Intermediate","slides":"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/slideshow\/embed_code\/key\/jHW7yhZeysUzxC","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0QY-QSFaKUQ?feature=oembed","co_authors":"","url":"http:\/\/confengine.com\/agile-india-2014\/proposal\/94","track_span":1,"slot":[1393491600,1393494300],"speakers":[{"name":"Carlos Lopes","key":"carlos-lopes","pic":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/112c7d46e3ab84d8bc55942f2b570ee7?s=50&r=pg&d=mm","link":"\/user\/carlos-lopes","country":"Brazil","flag":"\/assets\/img\/flags\/br.png","organization":"ThoughtWorks"}]}],"1393493100":[{"id":"71","track":"Track 2","conf_id":"agile-india-2014","room":"Esquire","timeslot":"2014-02-27 14:55:00","proposal_id":"194","title":"3Cs for Agile Project Success - Critical Success Factors & Proven Practices","duration":"20","abstract":"<p>Agile methodologies are gaining wider acceptance in Software Development and Testing due to its inherent values like Accelerate Time to Market, Eliminate Waste and flexible to adapt changes quickly.

To work with a single tech stack promotes a sense of mono culture which is detrimental and limiting the way a solution can be designed.

We used to have yearly releases of our product - a sort of big bang release with a host of new featres. Based on our stakeholder interactions, however, we figured that our software delivery wasn't agile enough for our customers. Users wanted new features incrementally throughout the year. They especially didn't want to wait a year for a feature that they'd requested that was critical for their business.<\/p>\r\n<p>So began our journey to Continuous Delivery - an interesting one for sure. It's not easy to deliver new features, manage technical debt, collaborate with users and incorporate their feedback into the new features - once every quarter. To do it consistently, with quality and on time, you need to have a framework in place - a combination of planning, process, automation and team organization - that lets teams focus on the right things to get to DONE DONE for their new features, and at the same time manage their quality and tecnical debt. Over the past year, we like to think that we've put that framework in place, and that is what I'd like to talk about in this session.<\/p>","session_type":"Experience Report","theme":"Agile Lifecycle","level":"Beginner","slides":"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0BwYBFB3pqkZsZmdkNnNwNDlwYkE\/edit?usp=sharing","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XlNNgtms1Q8?feature=oembed","co_authors":"","url":"http:\/\/confengine.com\/agile-india-2014\/proposal\/211","track_span":1,"slot":[1393575900,1393577100],"speakers":[{"name":"Sreerupa Sen","key":"sreerupa-sen","pic":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d98a75f037f122a8e595ebd6a602d6e1?s=50&r=pg&d=mm","link":"\/user\/sreerupa-sen","country":"India","flag":"\/assets\/img\/flags\/in.png","organization":"IBM"}]}],"1393578000":[{"id":"90","track":"Track 1","conf_id":"agile-india-2014","room":"Grand Ball Room","timeslot":"2014-02-28 14:30:00","proposal_id":"246","title":"Why The Project Paradigm Kills Innovation, and What To Do Instead","duration":"45","abstract":"<p>Projects were invented as a vehicle for managing civil engineering projects.

Here in this case the system could be a team member, the manager, the management, or the entire organization. While we work with assumptions, the conversations or the discussions or the work we do, can seem like getting nowhere because of the conflicts, and a sense of frustration piles on .This is a common situation and a very common feeling amongst Coaches\/Scrum masters\/Project Managers or anyone dealing with project management scenarios. That is where \"contracting\" helps us get our way through!<\/p>\r\n<p>Contracting is a concept of \"Transactional Analysis\" school of psychology. Eric Berne defines it as \"an explicit bilateral commitment to a well-defined course of action\". Sometimes contracts will be multi-handed - all parties to the contract will have their own expectations. In the unusual event that these are all congruent, then fine. However, if not, then discussing everyone's expectations will lead to greater understanding and therefore to a clear contract. The risk in not doing this is that problems in completing the contract will emerge at some stage.<\/p>\r\n<p>3 Categories of contracts are administrative, professional and psychological.<\/p>\r\n<p>Administrative contracts deals with the operational agreements- like fees, who has to do what, time, frequency, attendees etc.<\/p>\r\n<p>Professional contracts deals with the expectations from each role and clarifies the essential setup required to achieve the same<\/p>\r\n<p>Psychological contracts talks about how we work as people and help to understand how we express our comforts\/ discomforts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Amongst the three contracts psychological contracts are very essential and often ignored in projects. This type of contract will help us co-create any assignment and it&rsquo;s a powerful tool for Agile coaches while they work with their teams, managers, organization etc.<\/p>\r\n<p>Further to agree with any contract, both the parties should operate from a space where there is mutual trust and concern (I am Ok , You are Ok).<\/p>\r\n<p>This report will discuss in detail about these contracts with examples from Agile projects, in an activity based sessions.

Sadly, those models were predominantly based on industrial work, and don't really work that well in knowledge industry and today's sociological dynamics at workplace. Classical Agile methods codify several people practices that allow for a self-organizing team to evolve, but doesn't offer a lot of guidance on how to develop and groom leadership for agile organizations beyond a software team. Management 3.0 takes this issue further and develops it into a separate discipline altogether. On similar lines, Holacracy seeks to create social technology for purposeful organizations, though not specially targeting software organizations. So, the issue of leadership still continues to be unresolved and rather left to pave its way on its own. Unfortunately, when we want to achieve true end-to-end agility, it is not enough for software teams to be charging at top speeds but leadership not evenly matched to support them well in their endeavors. We clearly have a problem at hand...<\/p>\r\n<p>In this talk, we will study how the role of leadership has evolved and what does it look like for agile organizations at present. Many agile methods take an extreme view that limit leadership to team-level collective ownership of leadership. However, that might not be enough because of various reasons. In any non-trivial organization, whether a software organizations or any modern business employing software for business advantage, the reality is that organization units beyond a plain-vanilla software teams do exist. So, how does one go about grooming their top talent for playing an effective part in this process?<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, we will also try to take a shot at some of evolving paradigms. For example, all these management thoughts are still based on the kind of outdated premise that an organization is based on 'boundaries' of operations. However, already we see that model being broken down, and the future teams look more like boundaryless entities bound with nothing but a unifying purpose that brings a bunch of volunteers together for a period of time. If our success increasing depends on such teams being able to effectively self-manage themselves, what role does leadership have to play in it, and are we getting ready for it?&nbsp;<\/p>","session_type":"Talk","theme":"Beyond Agile","level":"Advanced","slides":"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/slideshow\/embed_code\/key\/GvEOo2S6TlJ7BC","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/az5GBr1um0A?feature=oembed","co_authors":"","url":"http:\/\/confengine.com\/agile-india-2014\/proposal\/157","track_span":1,"slot":[1393653600,1393656300],"speakers":[{"name":"Tathagat Varma","key":"tathagat-varma","pic":"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/bdd1fd492efd673ba6a5342cf9ec5df2?s=50&r=pg&d=mm","link":"\/user\/tathagat-varma","country":"India","flag":"\/assets\/img\/flags\/in.png","organization":"Thought Leadership"}]},{"id":"8","track":"Track 2","conf_id":"agile-india-2014","room":"Esquire","timeslot":"2014-03-01 11:30:00","proposal_id":"43","title":"Should we stop using Story Points and Velocity?","duration":"20","abstract":"<p class=\"p1\">On Agile projects we estimate user stories in order to allow team to<\/p>\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n<li class=\"li2\">1.

Cognitive skills:self-awareness about triggers, hot spots, emotions,behaviors. 2. Emotional skills:reading emotions, body language, balancing emotions, using curiosity 3. Behavioral skills:understanding others&rsquo; perspectives and needs, avoiding 8 destructive behaviors, embracing 8 constructive behavior. In an organizational setting, it is important to understand the source (culture, interdependence, incompatibility, personality, power, etc.) and types of conflict (cognitive vs. affective).

To create and collaborate to keep a customer is the purpose of an organisation. But still lots of companies try to make bad profits, i.e. profits earned at the expense of customer relationships. The Net Promoter System (NPS) is a renowned open-source system which addresses and measures customer collaboration. And did you know that you not only can use it to get feedback on your products and services, but also on your employees and your personal performance?<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">NPS is a perfect fit for Agile companies - and those who want to be. Most of the companies I worked with (Agile coaching, training, consulting) had not heard about it, and far less were actually using it. This really surprises me, since NPS integrates like a charm with Agile, e.g. within product development via Scrum.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this session I'll explain the basics of NPS, i.e. promoters and detractors, satisfied and delighted customers, bad profits (how to deal with bad feedback?) and good profits, and why and how to measure these. Several stories from companies like Apple Retail, Zappos, Southwest Airlines, and others will help to make my point. I&rsquo;ll further show why NPS is a very good fit with Agile regarding products, employees, and personal performance. Dos and Don&rsquo;ts regarding NPS (also from personal experience) will close this session. Related to the Don'ts, I also cover some of the negative critiques out there.<\/p>","session_type":"Talk","theme":"Beyond
