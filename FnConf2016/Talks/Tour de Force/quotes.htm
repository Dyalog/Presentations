<tr><td><script src="font.js" type="text/javascript"></script>We believe that the design of APL was also affected in important respects 
by a number of procedures and circumstances. 
Firstly, from its inception APL has been developed by <i>using</i> it in a succession of areas. 
This emphasis on application clearly favors practicality and simplicity. 
The treatment of many different areas fostered generalization &#133;</font></td></tr>

<tr><td><script src="font.js" type="text/javascript"></script>The mathematician&rsquo;s patterns, like the painter&rsquo;s 
or the poet&rsquo;s must be <i>beautiful</i>; 
the ideas like the colours or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way. 
Beauty is the first test: 
there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.</font>

<tr><td><script src="font.js" type="text/javascript"></script>Such were the vagaries of what may have been the most powerful computer 
language ever hatched by a Canadian.
Yes, I know that James Gosling, an alumnus of the University of Calgary, 
was the &ldquo;father of Java.&rdquo; He and I have talked about it. 
And yes, there is a now a game called &ldquo;Perl Golf&rdquo; in which 
you try to do the most work in that scripting language with the fewest number of (key-) strokes. 
Java and Perl are good and useful and popular, but APL was &#133; beautiful.</font>
